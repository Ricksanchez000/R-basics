Overview
Section 2 introduces you to vectors and functions such as sorting.

In Section 2.1, you will: 

Create numeric and character vectors. 
Name the columns of a vector. 
Generate numeric sequences. 
Access specific elements or parts of a vector.
Coerce data into different data types as needed. 
In Section 2.2, you will: 

Sort vectors in ascending and descending order. 
Extract the indices of the sorted elements from the original vector. 
Find the maximum and minimum elements, as well as their indices, in a vector. 
Rank the elements of a vector in increasing order. 
In Section 2.3, you will: 

Perform arithmetic between a vector and a single number.
Perform arithmetic between two vectors of the same length. 
There are three DataCamp assessments (one after each of the three sections), and one final assessment for you to practice your coding skills.

We encourage you to use R to interactively test out your answers and further your learning.



Vectors
# We may create vectors of class numeric or character with the concatenate function
codes <- c(380, 124, 818)
country <- c("italy", "canada", "egypt")

# We can also name the elements of a numeric vector
# Note that the two lines of code below have the same result
codes <- c(italy = 380, canada = 124, egypt = 818)
codes <- c("italy" = 380, "canada" = 124, "egypt" = 818)

# We can also name the elements of a numeric vector using the names() function
codes <- c(380, 124, 818)
country <- c("italy","canada","egypt")
names(codes) <- country

# Using square brackets is useful for subsetting to access specific elements of a vector
codes[2]
codes[c(1,3)]
codes[1:2]

# If the entries of a vector are named, they may be accessed by referring to their name
codes["canada"]
codes[c("egypt","italy")]
